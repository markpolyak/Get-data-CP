CodeBook for the tidy dataset
=============================

Data source
-----------
This dataset was derived from "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set", which was originally made avaiable at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
You can find the complete description of all features (measurments) in `features_info.txt` of the original dataset. In the dataset presented here only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement of the original dataset are used. 

Transformations
-----------------
* Test and train data are merged using the `rbind()` and `cbind()` functions. Merged are files having the same number of columns and referring to the same entities. For more info, please see the README in this repository.
* Only those columns with the mean and standard deviation of the measurements are taken from the whole dataset. The columns with measurments are assigned correct names from `features.txt`.
* As activity data is addressed with values 1:6, activity names and IDs are taken from `activity_labels.txt` and they are inserted in the dataset.
* A new dataset is generated by averaging the previous dataset by subject and activity type. The final averaged dataset consists of 30 subjects * 6 activities = 180 rows and 68 columns. The final tidy sataset is saved to `avg_har.txt` file, and is uploaded to this repository.
